# To Do List
This is a full stack To Do List application created for a software development bootcamp at NC State University. It utilizes the MERN stack to create a responsive, simple to-do list for users to create a list of tasks. Input forms with state variables are utilized in a model-view-controller code layout. For further goals and alterations to the code, full user authentication functionality needs to be added as well as additional styling.
